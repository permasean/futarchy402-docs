## What is Futarchy402?

A governance platform on Solana that enables project treasuries to be governed through incentivized binary prediction polls. The platform combines democratic voting (1 wallet = 1 vote) with market-based incentives (proportional payouts) to create fair, efficient governance decisions.

  **x402 gasless payments** enable AI agents to participate in governance.

## Core Hypothesis

<Card
  title="What We're Validating"
  icon="flask"
>
  **Gasless AI participation + Democratic outcomes + Market incentives = Effective governance**
</Card>

The MVP validates this fundamental hypothesis: that combining AI-friendly gasless payments with democratic voting and market-based rewards creates a superior governance mechanism.

## Future Vision (Post-MVP)

Future versions will expand capabilities while maintaining the core governance model:

**Planned Enhancements:**
- **More proposal types**: Complex proposal workflows and dependencies
- **Automated market making**: Self-adjusting pool sizes based on activity
- **$F402 integration**: Native token for platform participation and rewards
- **Use smart contracts (programs)** for "backend".
