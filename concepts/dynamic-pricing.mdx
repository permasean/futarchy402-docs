## Overview

The platform uses a **constant product market maker (CPMM)** to dynamically adjust vote entry fees based on market consensus. This creates fair, efficient pricing that rewards early voters and prevents whale manipulation.

  **Democratic Parimutuel Prediction Market with Proportional Payouts**
  
  - **Pricing**: Constant Product AMM  
  - **Outcome**: Democratic (1 wallet = 1 vote)  
  - **Payouts**: Plutocratic (proportional to stake)
</Card>

## Core Formula

The platform uses a constant product formula to calculate entry fees dynamically based on current market consensus. Entry fees adjust in real-time as votes are cast, creating a self-balancing market.

## Proportional Payouts

Winners share the total pot proportionally based on their stake.

### What's in the Pot?

The total payout pot consists of two sources:

1. **Poll Pool (Bonus)**: Initial USDC contributed from the treasury when the poll is created. This is a fixed bonus amount that incentivizes participation.

2. **Vote Entry Fees**: All USDC paid by voters (both winners and losers) as entry fees to cast their votes. These fees accumulate throughout the voting period.

**Total Pot = Poll Pool + All Vote Entry Fees**

This means even if you vote on the winning side, you're competing for a share of the combined pool that includes both the initial bonus and everyone's entry fees.

### How Payouts Work

Each winner receives a proportional share based on how much they paid relative to all winning votes:

**Your Payout = (Your Entry Fee / Total Winning Entry Fees) × Total Pot**

<Success>
  **Key Property**: All winners receive the **same ROI** regardless of entry price - perfectly fair!
</Success>

## Whale Resistance

The platform prevents wealthy actors from dominating outcomes through two key mechanisms:

**1. Democratic Voting (1 Wallet = 1 Vote)**

Outcomes are determined by vote count, not by money spent. To control the outcome, you need 51% of the votes - not 51% of the capital.

**2. Fixed Entry Fees**

Unlike traditional prediction markets where you can buy unlimited shares, each vote requires paying the current entry fee - no more, no less. You cannot buy multiple votes from a single wallet.

### Why Whales Can't Win

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="To dominate outcome" icon="gavel">
    **Requirement**: Need 51% of votes (not 51% of money)

    **Cost**: 51 wallets × current entry fee

    **Problem**: Entry fee increases with each vote, making bulk buying exponentially expensive
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="To dominate payouts" icon="coins">
    **Requirement**: Create 51 wallets, pay 51× entry fees

    **Result**: Expensive, inefficient, and must share winnings 51 ways

    **Disincentive**: ROI is the same for all winners - no advantage to Sybil attack

## Fairness Analysis

| Dimension | Verdict | Reasoning |
|-----------|---------|-----------|
| **Economic** | ✅ FAIR | No arbitrage, proportional rewards, info revelation |
| **Democratic** | ✅ FAIR | 1 wallet = 1 vote, majority wins, whale-resistant |
| **Game-Theoretic** | ✅ FAIR | Truth-telling incentivized, early bets rewarded |
| **Distributional** | ⚠️ MIXED | Early voters advantaged (by design) |

<Tip>
  Early voters get better prices, but all winners receive the same ROI. This incentivizes participation while maintaining fairness.
